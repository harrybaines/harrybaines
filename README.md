#### Building software and tinkering with AI tools before the AI apocalypse

I've built and sold a [full-stack time management system](https://www.harrybaines.net/blog/archtms) to a large architecture practice. I'm currently finalising a second version with more advanced features.

More about me:

- 👨🏻‍💻 **Software Engineer** with 5+ years experience building full-stack applications.
- 📈 **Data Scientist** with 2 years experience building and deploying ML models and applications.
- 🎓 **BSc Computer Science** (First Class) & **MSc Data Science** (Distinction) @ Lancaster University.

I also enjoy contributing to open source projects:

- 🌀 [Ivy](https://github.com/unifyai/ivy): ML framework transpiler and unified framework.
- 🖊️ [Buildspace Projects](https://github.com/buildspace/buildspace-projects): AI avatar tutorial project on Buildspace projects.

My principles:
- Be helpful
- Be curious
- Teach others what you know
- Embrace the power of 1% improvements
