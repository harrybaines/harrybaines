📔 My principles

- 🧱 **Keep it simple**: Don't overcomplicate the code if it can be written simpler.
- 🧔 **Own what you build**: I care about what I build and how it works inside out.
- 📝 **Care about the details**: Security, performance, UX, it all matters.
- 🌱 **Help others grow**: Teach things you learn to others, share what you know.
- 📚 **Stay curious**: always be on the lookout to learn new things.
- 🧠 **Embrace AI**: because if you don't, chances are you'll be left behind!

I'm always open for new opportunities, ping me an email and we can chat over coffee! ☕
