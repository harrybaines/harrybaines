#### Building software and tinkering with AI tools before the AI apocalypse

Read more about me on my [portfolio website](https://www.harrybaines.net/).

I've built and sold a [full-stack time management system](https://www.harrybaines.net/blog/archtms) to a large architecture practice. I'm currently finalising a second version with more advanced features.
