üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Hi! I'm Harry.

*Building software and tinkering with AI tools before the AI apocalypse*

- **Software Engineer** with 5+ years experience building full-stack applications.
- **Data Scientist** with 2 years experience building and deploying ML models and applications.
- **BSc Computer Science** (First Class) & **MSc Data Science** (Distinction) @ Lancaster University.

I've built a [full-stack time management](https://www.harrybaines.net/projects/archtms) system for a large architecture practice. I'm currently finalising a second version with more advanced features.

I also enjoy contributing to open source projects:

- [Ivy](https://github.com/unifyai/ivy): ML framework transpiler and unified framework.
- [Buildspace Projects](https://github.com/buildspace/buildspace-projects): AI avatar tutorial project on Buildspace projects.
### My principles:
- Be helpful
- Be curious
- Teach others what you know

You can read more about me on my [portfolio website](https://www.harrybaines.net/).
