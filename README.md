📔 My principles

- **Keep it simple**: Don't overcomplicate the code if it can be written simpler.
- **Own what you build**: I care about what I build and how it works inside out.
- **Care about the details**: Security, performance, UX, it all matters.
- **Help others grow**: Teach things you learn to others, share what you know.
- **Stay curious**: always be on the lookout to learn new things.

I'm always open for new opportunities, ping me an email and we can chat over coffee! ☕
